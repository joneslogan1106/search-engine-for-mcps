## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

1. **Use TypeScript strict mode** - All code must pass strict type checking
2. **Explicit types** - Use explicit types for function parameters and return values
3. **Interfaces over types** - Prefer interfaces for object types
4. **No `any` types** - Avoid using `any`; use proper typing

```typescript
// Good
interface ServerConfig {
  name: string;
  port: number;
  enabled: boolean;
}

function createServer(config: ServerConfig): Promise<Server> {
  // implementation
}

// Avoid
function createServer(config: any): any {
  // implementation
}
```

### Code Style

1. **ESLint configuration** - Follow the project's ESLint rules
2. **Prettier formatting** - Use Prettier for consistent formatting
3. **Naming conventions**:
   - `camelCase` for variables and functions
   - `PascalCase` for classes and interfaces
   - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

4. **File organization**:
   - One class/interface per file
   - Group related functionality
   - Clear import organization

### Error Handling

1. **Use specific error types** - Create custom error classes when appropriate
2. **Proper error propagation** - Don't swallow errors silently
3. **Logging** - Use the project's logging system

```typescript
// Good
import { MCPError, ErrorType } from './utils/errorTypes';

try {
  await connectToServer();
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to connect to server:', error);
  throw new MCPError(ErrorType.CONNECTION_ERROR, 'Server connection failed', error);
}

// Avoid
try {
  await connectToServer();
} catch (error) {
  // Silent failure
}
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Async/await** - Use async/await over promises where possible
2. **Resource cleanup** - Properly clean up resources (connections, timers, etc.)
3. **Memory management** - Avoid memory leaks in long-running processes

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

1. **Test files** - Place tests next to the code they test with `.test.ts` extension
2. **Test organization** - Group related tests using `describe` blocks
3. **Test naming** - Use descriptive test names

```typescript
describe('ServerManager', () => {
  describe('connectToServer', () => {
    it('should successfully connect to a valid MCP server', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should throw error when connection fails', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

5. **Co-located unit tests** - Place unit tests next to source files with `.test.ts` extension
6. **E2E test fixtures** - Use dedicated test servers in `/test/e2e/fixtures/`

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions/methods (co-located with source files)
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions (included in E2E suite)
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete workflows (separate test directory with fixtures)

### Test Framework

We use **Vitest** as our testing framework:

- **Unit Tests:** Fast, parallel execution with coverage
- **E2E Tests:** Sequential execution with longer timeouts
- **Coverage:** V8 provider with HTML/JSON/text reporting
- **Global Setup:** E2E tests have dedicated setup/teardown infrastructure

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Arrange, Act, Assert** - Structure tests clearly
2. **Mock external dependencies** - Use mocks for external services
3. **Test edge cases** - Include error conditions and boundary cases
4. **Cleanup** - Clean up resources after tests

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, parallel)
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:unit:watch
pnpm test:unit:coverage

# E2E tests (sequential, with fixtures)
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:e2e:watch
pnpm test:e2e:coverage

# Debug with MCP Inspector
pnpm inspector
```

```typescript
import { vi } from 'vitest';

describe('ClientManager', () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it('should retry failed connections with exponential backoff', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const mockTransport = vi.fn().mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('Connection failed'));

    // Act
    const result = await clientManager.connect(mockTransport);

    // Assert
    expect(mockTransport).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3);
  });
});
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

1. **JSDoc comments** - Document public APIs
2. **Inline comments** - Explain complex logic
3. **README updates** - Update README for user-facing changes

```typescript
/**
 * Connects to an MCP server with retry logic and exponential backoff.
 *
 * @param transport - The transport configuration for the server
 * @param options - Connection options including retry settings
 * @returns Promise that resolves to the connected server instance
 * @throws {MCPError} When connection fails after all retries
 */
async connectToServer(
  transport: Transport,
  options: ConnectionOptions = {}
): Promise<Server> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Architecture Documentation

1. **Design decisions** - Document significant architectural choices
2. **Patterns used** - Explain design patterns and their benefits
3. **Data flow** - Document how data flows through the system

### User Documentation

1. **Clear examples** - Provide working code examples
2. **Step-by-step guides** - Break down complex procedures
3. **Troubleshooting** - Include common issues and solutions

# 1MCP - One MCP Server for All

A unified Model Context Protocol server implementation that aggregates multiple MCP servers into one.

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@1mcp/agent)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@1mcp/agent)
[![NPM License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@1mcp/agent)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@1mcp/agent)
[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@1mcp-app/agent)](https://smithery.ai/server/@1mcp-app/agent)

## Overview

1MCP (One MCP) is designed to simplify the way you work with AI assistants. Instead of configuring multiple MCP servers for different clients (Claude Desktop, Cherry Studio, Cursor, Roo Code, Claude, etc.), 1MCP provides a single, unified server that:

- Aggregates multiple MCP servers into one unified interface
- Reduces system resource usage by eliminating redundant server instances
- Simplifies configuration management across different AI assistants
- Provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and resources
- Supports dynamic configuration reloading without server restart
- Handles graceful shutdown and resource cleanup
- Includes comprehensive authentication and security features
- Supports advanced filtering, pagination, and request optimization

## Quick Start

To enable Cursor to use existing MCP servers already configured in Claude Desktop, follow these steps:

1. Run the 1MCP server with the Claude Desktop config file:

```bash
npx -y @1mcp/agent --config ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

2. Add the 1MCP server to your Cursor config file (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "1mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3050/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Enjoy it!

## Usage

You can run the server directly using `npx`:

```bash
# Basic usage (starts server with SSE transport)
npx -y @1mcp/agent

# Use existing Claude Desktop config
npx -y @1mcp/agent --config ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Use stdio transport instead of SSE
npx -y @1mcp/agent --transport stdio

# Show all available options
npx -y @1mcp/agent --help
```

## Docker

You can also run 1MCP using Docker:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/1mcp-app/agent:latest

# Run with HTTP transport (default)
docker run -p 3050:3050 ghcr.io/1mcp-app/agent

# Run with a custom config file
docker run -p 3050:3050 -v /path/to/config.json:/config.json ghcr.io/1mcp-app/agent --config /config.json

# Run with stdio transport
docker run -i ghcr.io/1mcp-app/agent --transport stdio
```

Available image tags:

- `latest`: Latest stable release
- `vX.Y.Z`: Specific version (e.g. `v1.0.0`)
- `sha-<commit>`: Specific commit

Example:

```bash
docker run -p 3051:3051 \
  -e ONE_MCP_PORT=3051 \
  -e ONE_MCP_TAGS=network,filesystem \
  ghcr.io/1mcp-app/agent
```

### Understanding Tags

Tags help you control which MCP servers are available to different clients. Think of tags as labels that describe what each server can do.

#### How to Use Tags

1. **In your server config**: Add tags to each server to describe its capabilities

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "web-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"],
      "tags": ["network", "web"],
      "disabled": false
    },
    "file-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "~/Downloads"],
      "tags": ["filesystem"],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

2. **When starting 1MCP in stdio mode**: You can filter servers by tags

```bash
# Only start servers with the "network" tag
npx -y @1mcp/agent --transport stdio --tags "network"

# Start servers with either "network" or "filesystem" tags
npx -y @1mcp/agent --transport stdio --tags "network,filesystem"
```

3. **When using SSE transport**: Clients can request servers with specific tags

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "1mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3050/sse?tags=network" // Only connect to network-capable servers
    }
  }
}
```

Example tags:

- `network`: For servers that make web requests
- `filesystem`: For servers that handle file operations
- `memory`: For servers that provide memory/storage
- `shell`: For servers that run shell commands
- `db`: For servers that handle database operations

## Configuration

### Global Configuration

The server automatically manages configuration in a global location:

- macOS/Linux: `~/.config/1mcp/mcp.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/1mcp/mcp.json`

### Configuration File Format

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"],
      "disabled": false
    },
    "server-memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### System Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "AI Assistants"
        A1[Claude Desktop]
        A2[Cursor]
        A3[Cherry Studio]
        A4[Roo Code]
    end

    subgraph "1MCP Server"
        MCP[1MCP Agent]
    end

    subgraph "MCP Servers"
        S1[Server 1]
        S2[Server 2]
        S3[Server 3]
    end

    A1 -->|http| MCP
    A2 -->|http| MCP
    A3 -->|http| MCP
    A4 -->|http| MCP

    MCP --> |http| S1
    MCP --> |stdio| S2
    MCP --> |stdio| S3
```

### Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as AI Assistant
    participant 1MCP as 1MCP Server
    participant MCP as MCP Servers

    Client->>1MCP: Send MCP Request
    activate 1MCP

    1MCP->>1MCP: Validate Request
    1MCP->>1MCP: Load Config
    1MCP->>MCP: Forward Request
    activate MCP

    MCP-->>1MCP: Response
    deactivate MCP

    1MCP-->>Client: Forward Response
    deactivate 1MCP
```

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build the server:

```bash
pnpm build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:

```bash
pnpm watch
```

Run the server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Debugging

Using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
pnpm inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.

## Debugging & Source Maps

This project uses [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) to enhance stack traces. When you run the server, stack traces will reference the original TypeScript source files instead of the compiled JavaScript. This makes debugging much easier, as error locations and line numbers will match your source code.

No extra setup is required—this is enabled by default. If you see a stack trace, it will point to `.ts` files and the correct line numbers. 🗺️

# E2E Testing for 1MCP Agent

This directory contains comprehensive end-to-end tests for the 1MCP agent, covering both stdio and HTTP transports with real MCP protocol communication.

## Test Structure

```
src/test/e2e/
├── fixtures/           # Test MCP servers
├── utils/             # Test utilities and helpers
├── stdio/             # Stdio transport E2E tests
├── http/              # HTTP transport E2E tests
├── integration/       # Multi-transport integration tests
└── setup/             # Global test setup/teardown
```

## Test Fixtures

The test fixtures include simple MCP servers for various testing scenarios:

- **echo-server.js** - Reflects all requests for basic communication testing
- **error-server.js** - Returns various error conditions for error handling tests
- **capability-server.js** - Tests resource/tool/prompt capabilities
- **slow-server.js** - Introduces delays for timeout testing
- **crash-server.js** - Intentionally crashes for error scenario testing

## Running E2E Tests

### Working Demo Tests (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the working infrastructure demo
pnpm test:e2e:demo

# Or run all E2E tests (currently only demo tests)
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Watch Mode

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:watch
```

### Full Test Suite (Future)

```bash
# Stdio transport tests (requires MCP SDK fixes)
pnpm test:e2e:stdio

# HTTP transport tests (requires full implementation)
pnpm test:e2e:http

# Integration tests (requires working servers)
pnpm test:e2e:integration
```

### Combined Unit + E2E Tests

```bash
pnpm test:all
```

## Current Status

✅ **Working Components:**

- E2E test directory structure and organization
- Test utilities (ConfigBuilder, ProtocolValidator, TestProcessManager)
- Test configuration generation and management
- Protocol validation for JSON-RPC and MCP messages
- Basic process management for test scenarios

⚠️ **Pending Components:**

- MCP test servers (require SDK compatibility fixes)
- Full stdio transport E2E tests (require working test servers)
- HTTP transport E2E tests (require full HTTP implementation)
- Integration tests (require working MCP protocol communication)

The E2E test infrastructure is complete and demonstrated with working tests. The comprehensive test suites await resolution of MCP SDK compatibility issues and full server implementation.

## Test Categories

### Stdio Transport Tests

- **stdio-lifecycle.test.ts** - Process management and server lifecycle
- **stdio-protocol.test.ts** - MCP protocol communication over stdio
- **stdio-errors.test.ts** - Error handling and edge cases
- **stdio-integration.test.ts** - Full client workflow scenarios

### HTTP Transport Tests

- **http-auth.test.ts** - OAuth 2.1 authentication flows
- **http-mcp.test.ts** - MCP protocol over HTTP
- **http-management.test.ts** - Management API endpoints
- **http-sessions.test.ts** - Session management and lifecycle

### Integration Tests

- **multi-transport.test.ts** - Mixed stdio + HTTP server scenarios
- **performance.test.ts** - Performance and load testing

## Test Utilities

### TestProcessManager

Manages child process lifecycle for stdio servers:

```typescript
const processManager = new TestProcessManager();
const processInfo = await processManager.startProcess('test-server', {
  command: 'node',
  args: ['path/to/server.js'],
  timeout: 10000,
});
```

### McpTestClient

Test client for MCP protocol communication:

```typescript
const client = new McpTestClient({
  transport: 'stdio',
  stdioConfig: {
    command: 'node',
    args: ['server.js'],
  },
});
await client.connect();
const response = await client.listTools();
```

### ConfigBuilder

Dynamic test configuration generation:

```typescript
const config = ConfigBuilder.create()
  .enableStdioTransport()
  .enableHttpTransport(3000)
  .addStdioServer('echo', 'node', ['echo-server.js'])
  .writeToFile();
```

### ProtocolValidator

Validates MCP message compliance:

```typescript
const validation = ProtocolValidator.validateRequest(request);
expect(validation.valid).toBe(true);
```

## Configuration

E2E tests use a separate vitest configuration (`vitest.e2e.config.ts`) with:

- Extended timeouts (60s test timeout, 30s setup/teardown)
- Sequential execution to avoid port conflicts
- Retry logic for flaky network issues
- Global setup/teardown for environment preparation

## Environment Variables

- `NODE_ENV=test` - Set automatically during E2E tests
- `LOG_LEVEL=warn` - Reduces log noise during testing
- `MCP_DISABLE_CONSOLE=true` - Disables console logging in MCP servers
- `CI=true` - Enables single fork mode for CI environments

## Best Practices

### Writing E2E Tests

1. **Use real processes** - E2E tests spawn actual MCP server processes
2. **Test real protocols** - Use actual JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout or HTTP
3. **Handle async properly** - Always await process startup/shutdown
4. **Clean up resources** - Use beforeEach/afterEach for proper cleanup
5. **Expect failures** - Test error conditions and edge cases

### Performance Considerations

- Tests run sequentially to avoid port conflicts
- Each test gets a fresh server instance
- Random ports are used for HTTP tests
- Cleanup timeouts prevent hanging tests

### CI/CD Integration

E2E tests are designed to run in CI environments:

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Unix)
- Proper resource cleanup
- Reasonable timeout limits
- Retry logic for flaky conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts** - Tests use random ports, but conflicts can still occur
2. **Process cleanup** - Ensure proper cleanup in test teardown
3. **Timing issues** - Use appropriate waits for async operations
4. **Resource limits** - CI environments may have limited resources

### Debugging

- Use `test:e2e:watch` for interactive debugging
- Check process manager logs for startup issues
- Verify server fixture implementations
- Use protocol validator for message format issues

## Coverage and Quality

E2E tests complement unit tests by:

- Testing real process communication
- Validating protocol compliance
- Checking error handling under real conditions
- Performance testing with actual workloads
- Cross-platform compatibility verification

The E2E test suite provides confidence that the 1MCP agent works correctly in real-world scenarios with actual MCP servers and clients.
